This project summarized what companies asked what questions most during interviews(both phone and onsite)

**How to read the result?**
e.g:

{ 'Two Sum': [ 2, 'Easy', 'LinkedIn(39)', 'Google(39)' ],
  'Merge Two Sorted Lists': [ 2, 'Easy', 'LinkedIn(39)', 'Google(39)' ] }

It means the problem called "Two Sum" , which is asked by "2" companies, namely, LinkedIn and Google. The problem is considered "easy" by leetcode.com

**How to run the code?**

"**leetrank$ node rank.js**" under linux terminal


**What to do next?**
There are many other ways to sort the result. Now I sort the result by how many companies ask the problem. You can sort it other ways. The result is now in "object" format in JS, should not be too difficult to visualize it after converting it to JSON and then plot it using D3.js

Have fun!
